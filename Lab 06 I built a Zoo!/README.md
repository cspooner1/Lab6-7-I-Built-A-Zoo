Interface Definition
An interface in C# is a blueprint or contract that defines a set of methods, properties, and events that a class must implement. It establishes a standard for communication between different classes, enabling them to interact with each other based on a shared set of functionality. Interfaces allow for a form of multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces, but it cannot inherit from multiple classes.

Interfaces in the Zoo Code
ISwims Interface:

Description: The ISwims interface defines a contract for aquatic animals that can swim.
Example: The ClownFish class implements the ISwims interface because clownfish are known for their ability to swim in water. The interface provides the Swim() method, which can be implemented by the ClownFish class to specify how it swims.
IWalks Interface:

Description: The IWalks interface defines a contract for animals that walk on land.
Example: The Wolf class implements the IWalks interface because wolves are terrestrial animals that walk on legs. The interface provides the Walk() method, which can be implemented by the Wolf class to describe how wolves walk.
Interface Implementation
Interfaces are implemented in classes using the : symbol followed by the interface name. The implementing class must provide concrete implementations of all the methods and properties defined in the interface. In the zoo code, ISwims is implemented by the ClownFish class, and IWalks is implemented by the Wolf class.
